# 1. reduction to relation schemas
# ================================

# ==================
# strong entity sets

person(NATIONAL_CODE, first_name, last_name, birth_date, gender, special_disease)

# ================
# weak entity sets

# ======================================
# relation ship sets
# uppercase attributes show primary keys

# relating to doctor
deletes(USER_NAME, national_code) --> TODO: i think its wrong maybe
